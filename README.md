## Getting Started

Each implementation has its own directory with specific instructions for installation and running the game. See the individual README files within each directory for detailed information.

## Learning Progression

These three versions represent a progression in complexity and features:
1. Start with **Basic Blackjack** to understand the game rules and logic
2. Explore **Pygame Based Blackjack** to see how a graphical interface is implemented
3. Study **Flask & HTML & JS Based Blackjack** to learn about web-based multiplayer game development

## Requirements

- Python 3.x for all versions
- Additional requirements specific to each implementation (see individual READMEs)


## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the classic casino game Blackjack
